## Format voice profile
${fmt.voiceProfile}

## Founder voice guide (STYLE.md)
${style.trim() || "(STYLE.md not provided)"}

## Output file
Write the MDX to: \`apps/site/src/content/blog/${assignment.slug}.mdx\`

## EXACT frontmatter to emit
The frontmatter MUST validate against the site's blog content collection. Emit YAML with EXACTLY these fields:

\`\`\`yaml
---
title: "${assignment.title}"
format: ${assignment.format}
channels:
${channelsYaml}
summary: "<one-sentence summary>"
publishedAt: ${"<ISO 8601 datetime, e.g. the run date>"}
sources:
${sourcesYaml || '  - { title: "<title>", url: "<url>" }'}
draft: false
---
\`\`\`

- \`format\` MUST be exactly \`${assignment.format}\`.
- \`channels\` MUST be a non-empty list drawn from the site channel vocabulary.
- \`sources\` MUST be a non-empty list of \`{ title, url }\` — one entry per source you actually cite, each url drawn from the citation ledger below.
- ALSO include \`tier\` and \`origin\` on each source entry when you have them (copy them straight off that url's citation-ledger appraisal — \`high\`/\`med\`/\`low\` and \`curated\`/\`researched\`). Both fields are optional (older Reads shipped without them), but the site renders a "Sources & corroboration" rail from them, so always carry them through when the url is in your ledger.

${dossierSection}
${ledgerSection}
## Curated seed sources (starting points — research OUTWARD from these)
These are the curated FeedItems that seeded this assignment. Read their full text, then follow their citations, find the primary papers/official docs, and appraise every source you add.

${sourceBlock(sources)}

## Encouraged components (this format's kit)
Import these from \`@/components/mdx\` and prefer them over prose-only sections:
${fmt.componentKit.map((c) => `- <${c}>`).join("\n")}

## Grounding & verification mandate (non-negotiable)
- Research like a PhD thesis: literature search, source discovery, credibility appraisal, triangulation. You MUST research to build the citation ledger — do not stop at the seeds above.
- Ground EVERY factual claim in the citation ledger: every assertion must trace to a ledger source (curated OR researched). Load-bearing claims must be corroborated by ≥2 INDEPENDENT sources; prefer High-tier (primary/peer-reviewed) over secondary, secondary over Low.
- Reflect each cited url in the \`sources\` frontmatter array AND cite it inline (e.g. an \`<Annotation>\` or a link). Every \`sources\` url MUST be in the ledger.
- Do NOT fabricate facts, numbers, names, dates, or quotes. If a claim cannot be grounded in an appraised ledger source, cut it. A Low-tier source alone never grounds a load-bearing claim.
- Prefer interactive components over prose-only explanation — the chart/diagram should arrive before the words that explain it.
- Use ONLY components from the kit above; do not invent component names.

## Target length
${
    fmt.length === "feature"
      ? "Feature — 20–25 min read FLOOR (~5,000–7,000+ words, can go longer) with the FULL expanded per-format component kit. The length is EARNED from more scenes / data layers / mechanism coverage / worked examples / knowledge-carrying components — never from padding or hedging. Target at least one knowledge-carrying island (Chart/Diagram/Simulation/Figure/Stepper/Table/Scrolly/StateMachine/etc.) per ~800–1,000 words: components carry blocks of knowledge, prose wraps around them to interpret."
      : "Brief (~300–500 words). The 20–25 min feature floor does NOT apply — brevity is this format's craft; do not pad a briefing."
  }
